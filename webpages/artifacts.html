				<h3> Communication Systems</h3>
				
				<p id = artifacts>
				<img src="../images/bridge.jpg" style="width:130px;height:180px;">In Communication Systems last 
				year we were told do disign and build a bridge, and partners and I went with this design.
				We had it aproved by our instructor and we built it, then it came time to test how much weight it 
				could hold we came in first place in our period and third in class. Now what we didn't know was that 
				the basic design we went with often times didn't hold much but the instructor like the way it look
				so he let use go along with it and we exeled.

				Over the summer and on occasion after and days off of school I worked at Vally Line inc. 
				I was hired for taping off busses to be painted. I've also painted a truck buffed and waxed a couple
				busses and get jobs that varied between sweaping to helping with body work.

				<h3>Leo Club</h3>
				<p id = artifacts>
				<img src="../images/aunt.jpg" style="width:100px;height:145px;"> Leo club in the picture was not 
				a sonsored event but I do not have anyphontos of those events. But none the less it is the same goal.
				My Aunt, Uncle, and cousin did a walk to end hunger at the Ford City track. And the Leo sponced events
				I have protipated in invales setting up for launch with Santa, preparing food for thanksgiving, food drives,
				and other things alike.
